## Maximizing AI Performance on a Budget

In today's technology-driven era, developing and testing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models and Large Language Models (LLMs) locally has become a favorite pastime for developers and researchers alike. Imagine having your own personal playground where you can experiment with the latest in AI technology—like DeepSeek R1 or creating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)—all without breaking the bank! Setting up a Proxmox LXC container with GPU capabilities can supercharge your local environment, making it faster and more efficient. This guide will help you transform your hardware or old gaming rig into a supercharged setup!

## Why Use Proxmox LXC Containers?

Proxmox LXC containers offer several advantages over traditional virtual machines (VMs), including lower overhead, faster boot times, and easier resource management. They also allow you to share the GPU among multiple LXC containers instead of locking it to a single VM. This makes them ideal for efficiently sharing hardware resources across different workloads.

### LXC vs. Docker

LXC (Linux Containers) and Docker are both technologies used to create isolated environments, but they serve slightly different purposes and have distinct characteristics:

- LXC: Primarily used for system-level virtualization where users need fine-grained control over container configurations.
- Docker: Designed to simplify application deployment and management by providing an easy-to-use interface and extensive tooling.

Docker running inside LXC combines the best of both worlds. This setup allows you to benefit from of both lightweight isolation through LXC and robust application deployment features with Docker, including GPU acceleration.

## High level steps

1. [Install NVIDIA Drivers on the Proxmox host](#host-drivers)
2. [Create New Proxmox LXC Container](#new-lxc)
3. [Enable GPU Passthrough to the LXC container](#gpu-passthrough)
4. [Install NVIDIA Drivers Inside the LXC Container](#lxc-drivers)
5. [Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit Inside the LXC](#lxc-toolkit)

## Prerequisites

- **GPU**: NVIDIA 3090 with 24GB VRAM or similar. More VRAM is better for running larger LLM models.
- **Operating System**: Tested with the latest [Proxmox VE 8.3](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads)

I got a used NVIDIA card on Facebook Marketplace for around $600 that is great value at this time. It can run LLMs with over 32B pretty well, even on my 12 years old machine with Intel i7-5820K CPU and 64Gb DDR4 memory.

## Install NVIDIA Drivers on the Proxmox host {#host-drivers}

Before creating LXC container, make sure to have the proprietary NVIDIA drivers installed and working on the Proxmox host.

1. **Install kernel headers and build dependencies**

   - Login to your Proxmox server’s web interface and navigate to the “Shell” in the top right corner.

   ```bash
   apt install pve-headers pkg-config libglvnd-dev nvtop -y
   apt install dirmngr ca-certificates software-properties-common apt-transport-https dkms git -y
   ```

2. **Download the latest NVIDIA drivers**

   - Option 1: Using Official [NVIDIA drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers) page
   - Option 2: Using [NVIDIA GitHub repo](https://github.com/keylase/nvidia-patch) (Recommended)

   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   wget http://international.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/570.124.04/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-570.124.04.run
   ```

3. **Install NVIDIA drivers and Reboot**

   ```bash
   chmod +x NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-570.124.04.run
   ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-570.124.04.run --no-questions --ui=none --disable-nouveau
   ```

4. **Check everything is working**

   - Run nvidia-smi and should see the GPU info.

   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   ```

   ![nvidia-smi](~/assets/images/nvidia-smi.png)

### Create New Proxmox LXC Container {#new-lxc}

The community [Proxmox VE Helper-Scripts](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=docker) make this step a breeze. Copy/paste the one-liner below in Proxmox shell.

1. **Access the Proxmox Web Interface**

   - Login to your Proxmox server’s web interface and navigate to the “Shell” in the top right corner.

2. **Run the LXC script**

   - Paste this command to start the LXC script and select the **Default settings**.
   - Don't forget to install Portainer at the end, if you like.

   ```bash
   bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/raw/main/ct/docker.sh)"
   ```

### Enable GPU Passthrough to the LXC container {#gpu-passthrough}

1. **Check the NVIDIA cgroup IDs**:

   Run this command:

   ```bash
   ls -al /dev/nvidia*
   ```

   ![nvidia-cgroups](~/assets/images/nvidia-cgroups.png)

   The output will be similar if you have a single GPU (nvidia0) and the universal groups for nvidiactl, nvidia-uvm, nvidia-uvm-tools, nvidia-cap1, and nvidia-cap2. Note the IDs listed in the output, such as **195**, **235**, and **238**. For multiple GPUs, there will just be more lines. These IDs will be unique to your system, so make sure to take note of them for use in the next step.

2. **Add NVIDIA group IDs to LXC config for GPU Passthrough**:

   - Edit the LXC config `/etc/pve/lxc/xxx.conf`
   - Reboot your system to apply changes.

   ```bash
   # Example
   nano /etc/pve/lxc/103.conf
   ```

   - Copy/Paste to append these lines with your group IDs and save.

   ```bash
   lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 195:* rwm
   lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 235:* rwm
   lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 238:* rwm
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/nvidia0 dev/nvidia0 none bind,optional,create=file
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/nvidiactl dev/nvidiactl none bind,optional,create=file
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/nvidia-modeset dev/nvidia-modeset none bind,optional,create=file
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/nvidia-uvm dev/nvidia-uvm none bind,optional,create=file
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/nvidia-uvm-tools dev/nvidia-uvm-tools none bind,optional,create=file
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/nvidia-caps/nvidia-cap1 dev/nvidia-caps/nvidia-cap1 none bind,optional,create=file
   lxc.mount.entry: /dev/nvidia-caps/nvidia-cap2 dev/nvidia-caps/nvidia-cap2 none bind,optional,create=file
   ```

   Restart the LXC container after saving the config file.

3. **Verify GPU Passthrough**

   - Login to your Proxmox server’s web interface, select the LXC container and navigate to the “Console” in the top right corner.
   - At this stage, you should see the NVIDIA groups show up inside the LXC container with the same commands we used earlier on the host side:

   ```bash
   ls -al /dev/nvidia*
   ```

   ![nvidia-cgroups2](~/assets/images/nvidia-cgroups2.png)

### Install NVIDIA Drivers Inside the LXC Container {#lxc-drivers}

This step is very similar to installing the drivers on the host, but the commands vary slightly.

1. **Download the NVIDIA driver inside the LXC**

   - Login to your Proxmox server’s web interface, select the LXC container and navigate to the “Console” in the top right corner.
   - Download the driver

   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   wget http://international.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/570.124.04/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-570.124.04.run
   ```

2. **Install drivers and restart the LXC**

   - **Note** we are skipping the kernel modules this time

   ```bash
   chmod +x NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-570.124.04.run
   ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-570.124.04.run --no-questions --ui=none --no-kernel-modules
   reboot
   ```

3. **Check everything is working**

   - Run nvidia-smi and should see the GPU info.

   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   ```

### Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit Inside the LXC {#lxc-toolkit}

1. **Add the NVIDIA repo**

   - Login to your Proxmox server’s web interface, select the LXC container and navigate to the “Console” in the top right corner.

   ```bash
   # Install dependency
   apt install gpg curl -y

   # Add the NVIDIA signing key
   curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg

   # Add the NVIDIA repo to sources list
   curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list

   # Update cache
   apt update
   ```

2. **Install nvidia-container-toolkit**

   ```bash
   apt install nvidia-container-toolkit -y
   ```

3. **Enable cgroups**

   - Edit the config.toml and set the **no-cgroups** to **true** from false
   - Save and restart the LXC container

   ```bash
   nano /etc/nvidia-container-runtime/config.toml
   reboot
   ```

   ![nvidia-cgroups3](~/assets/images/nvidia-cgroups3.png)

4. **Set up the NVIDIA Container Toolkit to work with Docker**

   ```bash
   nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker
   reboot
   ```
